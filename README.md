# PongGame_Using_Turtle
Small pong game in python using the Turtle graphics library. 

This is one of the first "projects" I had in mind, when I started programming it, I was very new at programming which is why the code is absolutely awful.

This is absolutely nothing important or complicated of a project but I am still happy that I did this quite a while ago now.
